# Assignment Obj-Stl reader and tranlator

This repository contains code for four assignments related to reading and converting 3D geometry files:

1. **STL Reader**: This assignment focuses on reading STL (Stereolithography) files and storing the points into a text file.

2. **OBJ Reader**: This assignment involves reading OBJ (Wavefront Object) files and storing the points into a text file.

3. **STL to OBJ Converter**: Here, the code converts STL files into OBJ format and stores the output into an OBJ file.

4. **OBJ to STL Converter**: This assignment deals with converting OBJ files into STL format and storing the output into an STL file.

## Instructions for Usage

1. **STL Reader**:
   - Run the `stl_reader.cpp` file.
   - Provide the path to the STL file you want to read.
   - The code will extract the points from the STL file and store them into a text file.

2. **OBJ Reader**:
   - Execute the `obj_reader.cpp` file.
   - Input the path to the OBJ file you wish to read.
   - The program will extract the points from the OBJ file and save them into a text file.

3. **STL to OBJ Converter**:
   - Run the `stl_to_obj_converter.cpp` file.
   - Specify the path to the STL file you want to convert.
   - The code will convert the STL file into OBJ format and save the output into an OBJ file.

4. **OBJ to STL Converter**:
   - Execute the `obj_to_stl_converter.cpp` file.
   - Input the path to the OBJ file you want to convert to STL.
   - The program will convert the OBJ file into STL format and save the output into an STL file.

## Dependencies

The code may require certain libraries or dependencies to compile and run properly. Make sure to install any necessary libraries mentioned in the source files or readme.

## Note

Ensure that the input files (STL or OBJ) exist at the specified paths and have the correct format for successful execution of the programs.
